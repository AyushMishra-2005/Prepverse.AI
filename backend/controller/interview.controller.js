      Your task is to generate:

      1. A warm, professional **welcome message** for the candidate **${name}**, written as **three short parts in a single line** (no line breaks or \\n).
        - The entire message must be **under 200 words**.
        - Structure it as three logically separated parts (e.g., greeting + purpose + encouragement), but keep it in one continuous line.
        - Mention the job title clearly and naturally (e.g., “as a frontend developer” instead of “for this role”).
        - Use a professional but friendly tone.
        - Do **not** mention AI, mock interviews, or simulations.
        - Avoid line breaks, bullet points, and numbered lists.

      2. A **standalone transition phrase** to smoothly begin the first question.
        - It must be a **phrase or sentence fragment**, not a complete sentence or question.
        - It must **not** include any background, resume hints, or job-related content.
        - It must be **professional and slightly varied**, like “Let’s begin with” or “To get things started,”.
        - It must **not** contain a question mark.

        1. FEEDBACK (STRICT RULES):
          - Exactly 2 professional sentences

          - Only assess the answer — no suggestions, tips, or ratings
          - The tone must be objective and professional — avoid encouraging or consoling language
          - Only assess the answer — do not offer suggestions, praise, tips, or requests to try again
          - If the answer is incorrect, missing, or incomplete, state that directly and factually
          - Do not ask the candidate to answer the question again while giving feedback
          - If no answer was given, indicate that clearly and professionally

        2. END MESSAGE (STRICT RULES):
          - Generate a professional, warm, and slightly longer thank-you message (2–3 sentences)
          - Express appreciation for the candidate’s time, effort, and responses
          - Each time, use **different wording** — avoid repeating any previously used thank-you messages
          - Match the tone of this example, but do not copy it:  
            "Thank you for participating in this interview. Your insights were valuable and demonstrated thoughtful engagement. We appreciate the time and effort you invested."

        2. TRANSITION (STRICT RULES):

    You are an expert AI interview assistant.

    Your task:
    - Validate whether the given role and topic are appropriate and related.
    - If valid, generate an array of unique, concise, and orally answerable interview questions relevant to the role and topic.

    Constraints:
    1. Generate exactly ${numOfQns} unique and non-repetitive interview questions.
    2. Each question must be clear, focused, and easily answerable within a 30–60 second spoken response.
    3. All questions must be different in wording and focus — avoid redundancy.
    4. Avoid overly technical or essay-style questions unless essential to the role.
    5. For each question, estimate the expected time (in seconds) a candidate would take to answer it orally. Use the following scale:
        - Simple factual questions: 30–35 seconds.
        - Conceptual or reasoning-based questions: 40–50 seconds.
        - Scenario-based, open-ended, or multi-step questions: 50–60 seconds.
      Ensure a natural variation across the question list, based on complexity.

    Return your response strictly in the following JSON format:

    If valid:
    {
      "valid": true,
      "questions": [
        { "question": "First unique question?", "time": 30 },
        { "question": "Second unique question?", "time": 50 }
        // ...${numOfQns} total
      ]
    }

    If invalid (role and topic do not match or are inappropriate):
    {
      "valid": false,
      "questions": []
    }

    Role: ${role}
    Topic: ${topic}

    Only respond with the JSON object as described above. Do not include any explanations.`;
